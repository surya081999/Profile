## :man_technologist: About Me
I'm a highly motivated Infra Managed Service Associate at Accenture, with a strong passion for technology and an extensive background in crafting robust and scalable software solutions. 

🏢 **Accenture (Infra Managed Service Associate)**
- April 2022 - January 2024 (1 year 10 months)
- In my role here, I've been at the forefront of designing and developing software solutions that precisely align with business requirements. I've crafted implementation and integration approaches for applications, ensuring seamless functionality. Additionally, I've taken charge of primary support for application releases into production, meticulously planning and scheduling deployments. Whenever defects or performance issues arise within Service Level Agreements, I've been quick to coordinate and resolve them, ensuring minimal downtime. My dedication to enhancing system performance is evident through my thorough analysis, design, building, and testing of new components.


My proficiency extends to cloud computing and DevOps, underscored by a robust set of certifications:

I excel in leveraging cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to optimize application performance, streamline deployment and management, and ensure robust data handling.

My career is marked by successful projects, including the implementation of cloud-native solutions, migration of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, and the design of scalable and secure architectures. I've played a pivotal role in driving automation and CI/CD processes, enhancing development efficiency and reducing time to market.

Moreover, my strong project management abilities ensure successful project delivery within scope, timeline, and budget. I thrive in collaborative environments, excelling in cross-functional team collaboration and effective communication.

Outside of work, I actively engage in extracurricular activities, such as Kabaddi, which have instilled discipline, teamwork, and leadership skills. I remain a dedicated lifelong learner, staying updated with the latest industry trends and exploring new technologies. I actively contribute to open-source projects and participate in online communities to share knowledge and learn from industry experts.

Additionally, I'm proud to mention that I've joined the **AWS Certified Global Community**, further enhancing my network and expertise.
